# Neuromorphic Network-on-Chip Architecture for Spiking Neural Networks
___

## Description

### This project aims to develop a novel neuromorphic NoC architecture based on RISC-V ISA to support spiking neural network applications, and test it on FPGA.


Our research presents the design of a scalable and configurable Network-on-Chip (NoC) based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) which allows for hardware- level processing of spiking neural networks, and the implementation of the design on a FPGA. RISC-V was chosen as the base ISA since it is not only highly practical and popular, but also completely open source and amenable to custom extensions.

The main goal of this research is to optimize the RISC-V processing node network for low power by integrating custom accelerator hardware units.
